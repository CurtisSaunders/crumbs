# Crumbs
Framework agnostic breadcrumb container

Installation via composer
-------------------------

To install Crumbs via composer, simply add it to your composer.json file

```json
"require": {
    "coreplex/crumbs": "1.0.*"
},
```

Then run `composer update` via the command line. To automatically add this into your composer json, you can simply run `composer require coreplex/crumbs`, and composer will handle this all for you

The Container
-------------

All breadcrumbs are held in a **Container** class. This allows you to prepare and render a set of breadcrumbs. A container has two dependencies. A `Contracts\Crumb` instance, and a `Contracts\Renderer` instance. We provide basic ones in the repository to be used

```php
$container = new Coreplex\Crumbs\Container(new Coreplex\Crumbs\Components\Crumb, new Coreplex\Crumbs\Renderers\Basic);
```

To add a few breadcrumbs to the container, you can either use the `append` method directly, like so

```php
$container->append('Homepage', '/home');
```

Or you can use a closure to group them into their own scope. To do this, just call the `prepare` method and use any of the container functions on the passed instance

```php
$container->prepare(function($crumbs)
{
    $crumbs->append('Homepage', '/home')
           ->append('Edit');
});
```

To add a breadcrumb to the start of the container rather than the end, use the alternative `prepend` method

```php
$container->prepend('The Website', '/');
```

Rendering The Breadcrumbs
-------------------------

The basic renderer provided will return a simple list-based navigation string. This can be invoked through the main container class by just calling the `render` method.

```php
$container->render();
```

The render method causes the last breadcrumb to be active by default. To disable this behaviour, pass false as the first parameter when calling render.

```php
$container->render(false);
```

Laravel 5 Support
-------------------------
Crumbs has support for Laravel 5 out of the box. Once installed via composer, simply add the service provider to your app.php file

```php
'providers' => [

    'Coreplex\Crumbs\CrumbsServiceProvider',

]
```

And also publish the config via command line, using the `php artisan vendor:publish` function. This allows the config to be published to the correct directory

Once these steps have been taken, Crumbs can be dependency injected into any controller constructs like so

```php
/**
 * Make a new controller instance
 *
 * @param \Coreplex\Crumbs\Contracts\Container $breadcrumbs
 * @return void
 */
public function __construct(\Coreplex\Crumbs\Contracts\Container $breadcrumbs)
{
    $this->breadcrumbs = $breadcrumbs;
}
```

Which will then allow access to the breadcrumbs container via the breadcrumbs class property on the controller

A facade is also provided to those who would opt using this over dependency injection. Simply add it to the aliases array in app.php

```php
'aliases' => [

    'Crumbs' => 'Coreplex\Crumbs\Facades\Crumbs',

],
```

Which would then allow you to do things like this in your controllers

```php
use Crumbs;

class DashboardController extends Controller {

    public function index()
    {
        Crumbs::prepare(function($crumbs)
        {
            $crumbs->append('Dashboard Home', route('dashboard.index'));
        });

        return view('dashboard.index')->with('breadcrumbs', Crumbs::render());
    }

}
```
